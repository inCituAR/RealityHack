## inCitu x MIT Reality Hack

### **What we do**

[inCitu](https://www.incitu.us/) is bringing future cities to life via augmented reality to establish an effective collaboration between residents, developers, and city governments in the process of urban change. We turn planning and development data into mobile, real–world scale AR experiences, which are enabled through mobile apps, browser–based AR, and integrations to existing tech platforms and social media. All of our projects to date proved that AR creates more YIMBYs: experiencing future developments as if they are already built makes people more comfortable with change and with density in particular. 


### **Using inCitu data during the hackathon**

inCitu is a Sponsor of the MIT Reality Hack 2023 and an Esri partner. 
In this hackathon, inCitu is giving access to a **subset of our future development database**, featuring **3 real upcoming structures around the hackathon** area in Cambridge:  

250/290 Binney St. and 585 Kendall St. 

## How might we leverage complex real estate and GIS data into an elegant, tangible view of our built surroundings to create an informative, responsive, and empowering built environment to all?

The 3D assets are available for you to use in the following ways: 


### 1. Through ArcGIS

The layer can be accessed through any of the [ArcGIS SDKs](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/apis-and-sdks/),  \
