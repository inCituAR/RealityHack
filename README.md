# RealityHack
inCitu is bringing future cities to life via augmented reality, to establish an effective collaboration between residents, developers, and city governments in the process of urban change.
 
We turn planning and development data into a mobile-, real-scale AR experience, enabled through a mobile app, browser based AR, and through integrations to existing platforms and social media. All of our projects to date proved that AR creates more YIMBYs: experiencing future developments as if they are built makes people more comfortable with change, and with density in particular.
 
inCitu is an Esri Partner and a Sponsor to the MIT Reality Hack 2023; in this hackathon, inCitu is giving access to a subset of our future-development database, featuring 3 real upcoming structures around the hackathon area in Cambridge.  
 
The 3D assets are available for you to use in the following ways:
Through ArcGIS online, using different ArcGIS’s XR SDKs. 


Through Echo3D’s AR cloud
Link to assets, API Key, API secret   
For example, using Echo 3D -  SDK for Unity 

How might we experience this data and 3D visualizations of the future built environment for different applications? 
What are ways in which we might interact with this data? 

How might it impact our decisions as it relates to affordability, climate change
